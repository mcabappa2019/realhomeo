          “§1 THE physician’s high and only mission is to restore the sick to
          health, to cure …..” [“Organon of Medicine” by C. F. S. Hahnemann]
          Considering § 81 and “The Chronic Diseases” by S. Hahnemann, the word
          “sick” denotes the state where an individual has latent state of
          psoric miasm, which has gradually passed, in some hundreds of
          generations, through many millions of human organisms, by not
          producing any disagreeable sensation and morbid symptoms. (§ 11).
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          ● According to the principles of Real Homoeopathy, the word “sick”
          denotes (apparently) healthy individual who contains inactive harmful
          group of genes, responsible for different true diseases. Different
          harmful proteins produced by different groups of harmful genes are
          neutralized by beneficial proteins which are produced by beneficial
          group of genes, from which vital force originates. When harmful genes
          become overactive with the external as well as internal environments,
          the activities of beneficial genes are not observed. The harmonious
          cellular activities are disturbed by the excess harmful products in
          the cell. As a result, the internal economy of an individual becomes
          poisonous and different disagreeable sensations i.e. sufferings from
          different results of disease start gradually.
        </p>
        <p>
          ● All existing therapeutic systems, including classical homoeopathy,
          treat an individual for the present sufferings considering present
          symptoms, rubrics and pathological reports and give relief shortly,
          but the person becomes worse and worse gradually [J. T. Kent]. Real
          Homoeopathy, the exception, treats an individual without considering
          present sufferings, symptoms, rubrics and pathological reports, giving
          importance only to the philosophy of early life which is the proof of
          presence of active harmful genes, responsible for one or more true
          disease(s). Dr. Shyamal Kumar Das Since overactive harmful genes cause
          present sufferings, so any treatment that doesn’t consider philosophy
          of early life, responsible for one or more true diseases, causes
          complicated situations in the higher center, in the form of deviation
          from ideology, distortion of thought process and perversions with
          amelioration of physical symptoms. Due to such a complex mental state,
          painful physical sufferings from different results of disease, such as
          hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal failure, cardiac problem, liver
          problem, problem in the brain, etc., start gradually. Physical and
          mental peace and also simplicity is taken away from an individual with
          these types of existing therapeutic systems. “Prescribing for the
          results of disease causes changes in the results of disease, but not
          in the sickness except to hurry its progress.” [“Lectures on
          Homoeopathic Philosophy” by James Tyler Kent, Chapter: ‘The Sick’,

          ● Different abnormal behavior, sinful acts and criminal activities are
          the results of the procedure of treatment for quick amelioration of
          sufferings, without giving importance and consideration to the
          philosophy of early life i.e. active true diseases controlled by
          different active harmful genes.
        </p>
        <p>
          ● Only Real Homoeopathy allows a person to be free from any undesired
          inherited trait and also from any complicated mental as well as
          physical conditions created by suppressive and palliative type of
          treatment.{' '}

          the activities of harmful group of genes of an individual can be

          social bonds remain intact and the elderly members of the family are
          not seen in a helpless state, as there will be no activity of harmful
          genes and only activity of beneficial genes, responsible for vital

        <div className="ms-5">

          practically impossible. There is no other way to reach conclusive
          decision about miasmatic diagnosis without considering the
          individual’s philosophy of early life. Whereas, with the divine idea

          (idea) of the “constitution” by Stuart Close and something more. “That
          patient has the same disease he had when he was born. This array of
          symptoms represents the same state before the pathological conditions
          have been formed as after. And it is true, if he has liver disease or
          brain disease or any of the many tissue changes that they call
          disease, you must go back and procure these very symptoms before you
          can make a prescription. Prescribing for the results of disease causes
          changes in the results of disease, but not in the sickness except to
          hurry its progress.”

          The Sick, Page 23]
        </p>
        <p>
          The term “real homoeopathy” was first mentioned by Dr. James Tyler
          Kent in his book, “Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica,” chapter
          ‘Carbo vegetabilis,’ 30th paragraph. He has very beautifully
          mentioned: “You will be astonished, after ten years of real
          homoeopathic practice, that you have so few deformed babies; that they
          have all grown up and prospered; that their little defects and
          deformities have been outgrown, and that they are more beautiful than
          most children, because they have been kept orderly. The doctor watches
          and studies him, and feeds him a little medicine now and then, that
          the mother suspects is sugar, to keep on the good side of the baby.
          She need not know that it is medicine, or that anything is the matter
          with the baby. So he watches the development of that little one, grows
          him out of all his unhealthy tendencies. The children that grow up
          under the care of the homoeopathic physician will never have
          consumption, or Bright’s disease; they are all turned into order, and
          they will die of old age, or be worn out properly by business cares;
          they will not rust out. It is the duty of the physician to watch the
          little ones. To save them from their inheritances and their downward
          tendencies is the greatest work of his life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This means homoeopathy is a therapeutic science based on symptom
          similarity, and can be done two ways:{' '}
        </p>
        <div className="ms-5">
          <p>1. Superficial way of homoeopathic treatment, and </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            1] The superficial way of homoeopathic treatment is done by giving
            importance to the present situation i.e. present physical as well as
            mental signs and symptoms, present pathological report, etc. In a
            word, only present information— sensation, causation, location,
            modalities, concomitant, desires and aversions i.e. “the results of
            disease” are given the most importance. But the origin of “this
            present” i.e. “true diseases” is <b>never considered</b> seriously.
            Very few respectable homoeopathic physicians try to find out the
            miasmatic cause behind this present situation or sufferings, by
            using the present{' '}

            well as internal environments.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>● “causes changes in the results of disease”</b> means
            destruction of harmful product produced by harmful group of genes.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>● “not in the sickness” </b>means existence of six true diseases
            is not considered at all for the treatment. So production of harmful
            things cannot be stopped by the breaking of the chain of harmful
            reaction. Since the medicine does not consider the true disease, in
            spite of administrating similar medicine, the previous (poisonous)
            internal environment remains undisturbed.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>● “except to hurry its progress”</b> means the complications of
            the internal economy of the individual tend to increase rapidly.
            Because harmful product is destroyed by superficial, similar
            medicine but the production cannot be stopped with the breaking of
            chain of reaction. Rather, it increases gradually, as the active and
            overactive harmful group of genes responsible for different true
            diseases cannot be transformed into inactive one by the superficial
            similar medicine.{' '}

            nearest family members. Considering above indications, similar
            medicine is prescribed and patient becomes free from present
            sufferings in a short while. In this context, J. T. Kent has said:
            “Prescribing for the results of disease causes changes in the
            results of disease, but not in the sickness except to hurry its
            progress.”{' '}

          <p>
            It is the only therapeutic system that treats the apparently healthy
            individual (sick), giving utmost importance to the six true diseases
            with the help of philosophy of early life. To treat a patient with
            cough or cancer, the same procedure is followed strictly, without
            considering the present signs and symptoms of present sufferings of
            the patient i.e. “the results of the six true diseases”; only with
            the help of philosophy of early life, the six true diseases are
            considered for treating an individual suffering from any critical
            situation (results of disease). Because every individual starts its
            journey as a unicellular zygote in the mother’s womb, it contains
            one group of beneficial genes from which vital force originates and
            six groups of harmful genes which are responsible for the six true
            diseases and the source of innumerable “results of disease” when
            they become overactive. Generally the two types of genes run side by
            side, without disturbing one another. When the different active
            group of harmful genes are influenced and become overactive either
            naturally or with the influence of the external environment, the
            production of harmful protein starts increasing and the internal
            environment of the individual becomes poisonous with the harmful
            products, and different results of disease are observed.{' '}

          <p>
            The only procedure of treatment, following the principles of “GO

            transform active and overactive harmful group of genes to inactive
            one. As a result, a sick as well as a diseased individual will be
            able to fight against any adverse situation and with nature’s law.
            The individual must enjoy a perfectly healthy life in spite of any
            kind of unfavorable or polluted external environment if the
            treatment is done strictly following the principles of Real

              3] During case-taking, no information regarding symptom of present
              suffering is needed, but for the <b>evaluation</b> of treatment it
              is a must i.e. after taking Real Homoeopathic medicine one has to
              make sure if there is any change of consciousness towards
              positive, the sense of well-being (reasonable temperament, sound
              bowel movement, sound sleep, reasonable appetite and flexibility
              regarding choice of food items) is established or not.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              4] For the treatment of a child (up to the age of five), no
              information or symptom is needed. [Except stool, urine, appetite,
              weeping and cheerfulness which are <b>not needed</b> for the
              selection of medicine but for the evaluation of the situation
              after administration of similimum i.e. most similar medicine. In
              one word, it is needed for evaluation of treatment.]{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              5] Only eight medicines (Hydrophobinum, Psorinum, Drosera r.,
              Syphilinum, Thuja oc., Medorrhinum, Carbo veg., Carbo an.) out of
              eight thousand medicines are needed for the treatment of different
              kinds of patients all over the world.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              6] Materia Medica and Repertory are not needed for the selection
              of medicine <b>except materia medica on philosophy of life.</b>{' '}

          Note: “Symptoms” from Materia Medica and “rubrics” from Repertory
          indicate or express the information regarding the present situation
          i.e. results of disease, whereas philosophy of early life indicates
          the origin of this present situation i.e. the true diseases i.e.
          source of abnormal physical conditions or sufferings and deviations or
          perversions of mental state caused by the presence of harmful product
          in the human economy produced by harmful genes which are influenced
          and activated by the external as well as internal environments. Again,
          symptoms may be suppressed or palliated or annihilated with any
          medicine of any therapeutic system, whereas philosophy of early life
          may not; it can be changed only with the help of treatment strictly
          following the principles of “GO BACK” procedure of Real Homoeopathic
          therapeutic system. Homoeopathic science starts with symptoms which
          were known from “Drug-proving” and is related to “results of disease”
          which is going on for more than 225 years. According to J. T. Kent,
          homoeopathic treatment is of two types— superficial and real.
          Regarding superficial homoeopathic
        </p>
        <p>
          treatment, Kent has mentioned it in the fifth observation in his
          philosophy. And regarding Real Homoeopathic treatment J.T.Kent has
          mentioned in the chapter “Carbo vegetabilis” in his Materia Medica.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          According to advanced studies, Real Homoeopathy deals with “symptoms
          of true diseases” which is actually philosophy of early life. In Real
          Homoeopathy, medicine is selected{' '}
          <b>
            without considering any sign and symptoms of present results of
            disease.
          </b>{' '}
          This is the beauty of the “GO BACK” procedure in Real Homoeopathic
          therapeutic system.
